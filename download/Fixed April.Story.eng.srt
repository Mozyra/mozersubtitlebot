1
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:34,224
What time does it leave?

2
00:00:34,513 --> 00:00:35,829
23 past.

3
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,433
Soon, then.

4
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:41,568
- Here.
- Good luck.

5
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:45,498
Not yet?

6
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:50,441
Mr Nireno!

7
00:00:52,013 --> 00:00:53,329
Mr shoji!

8
00:00:54,831 --> 00:00:56,634
Going somewhere?

9
00:00:56,954 --> 00:00:59,456
My daughter's off to college.

10
00:00:59,807 --> 00:01:03,412
Oh, really? Where?

11
00:01:03,633 --> 00:01:05,436
In Tokyo.

12
00:01:05,582 --> 00:01:09,402
To Tokyo? Isn't that something!

13
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,365
Alone?

14
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:13,784
That's right.

15
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:17,891
I guess you'll miss her, won't you.

16
00:01:18,142 --> 00:01:20,194
Don't say that now!

17
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,454
Why not?

18
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:53,447
A Shunji Iwai Film

19
00:01:59,092 --> 00:02:02,212
Starring Takako Matsu

20
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,700
APRIL STORY

21
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:02,355
Uh, excuse me...

22
00:04:02,706 --> 00:04:06,455
Is Sakuragaoka Block 2
around here?

23
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:09,209
This is Block 2.

24
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,608
Sakuragaoka 2, um... ...2-4-5...

25
00:04:24,174 --> 00:04:29,073
Oh, there...
go straight ahead and turn left.

26
00:04:29,635 --> 00:04:32,376
Could you back up a bit?

27
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:36,480
Sorry to keep you waiting...
hurry!

28
00:04:40,838 --> 00:04:43,993
Sorry we took so long.

29
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:48,071
Watch your step.

30
00:04:50,893 --> 00:04:53,847
Don't hit your head.

31
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:56,453
Careful...

32
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,545
- Yes?
- Movers...

33
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:00,430
- Thanks.
- Could you prop the door open?

34
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:01,720
Yes

35
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,243
There...down on the floor.

36
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,647
Just wait here.

37
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:26,110
I'll help.

38
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:29,103
There's lots of it.
Just wait here.

39
00:06:31,163 --> 00:06:32,337
OK...

40
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:38,503
Hey hey hey hey!

41
00:06:38,922 --> 00:06:41,876
Small stuff later. Big stuff first.
Let's go!

42
00:06:51,934 --> 00:06:56,655
No, no, the big stuff! Come on!

43
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:04,868
The second floor...

44
00:07:07,277 --> 00:07:09,329
Newlyweds, I guess.

45
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,689
- Can you get by?
- No

46
00:07:52,123 --> 00:07:54,626
- Excuse me...
- Look out...

47
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:56,986
Oh, sorry...it won't all fit.

48
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,976
No, it won't.

49
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:36,366
Let's take some out.
Anything here you don't use?

50
00:08:37,248 --> 00:08:40,831
- Um...
- You'll need the fridge...

51
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,538
What about this bed?

52
00:08:43,858 --> 00:08:45,246
Uh, yeah...

53
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,638
How about this sofa?

54
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:54,226
It's pretty big...

55
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:59,543
You've got the bed.

56
00:08:59,724 --> 00:09:01,076
Mm...

57
00:09:01,812 --> 00:09:03,270
Dump it!

58
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:07,863
You'll watch TV, won't you.

59
00:09:08,109 --> 00:09:10,397
There's bedding for two...

60
00:09:11,031 --> 00:09:14,577
She won't need two.
She lives alone!

61
00:09:14,928 --> 00:09:16,624
What if a friend comes?

62
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:20,519
No one ever stayed at my place...

63
00:09:37,682 --> 00:09:41,501
- Sign this.
- Huh? Oh, yeah...

64
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:48,463
What should we do with this chair?

65
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:57,470
- You must like it a lot...
- Sure! Keep it!

66
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:58,830
Sure.

67
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,281
Thanks a lot!

68
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,142
Yes?

69
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,035
My name's Nireno. I just moved in.

70
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:25,392
This isn't much...
It's just something from Hokkaido.

71
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:30,435
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you.

72
00:11:30,685 --> 00:11:33,426
Same here. Nice to meet you.

73
00:11:33,747 --> 00:11:36,178
- Are you a student?
- Yes.

74
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,652
I see. Well, good luck.

75
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:40,320
- Thanks.
- See you.

76
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:48,612
The President will speak.

77
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:52,722
...no matter how global
a perspective we take...

78
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,026
...the 21st century will bring
many problems...

79
00:12:56,412 --> 00:12:59,152
...and the ability to solve them...

80
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:49,250
I'm Yumiko Kikuta.

81
00:13:49,505 --> 00:13:53,988
I went to girls' schools,
so I'm happy to be here.

82
00:13:54,653 --> 00:13:59,896
My hobbies are piano and tennis.
Nice to meet you.

83
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:05,220
I'm Haruki Yazawa, from Tokyo.

84
00:14:05,439 --> 00:14:08,072
My hobbies are football and travel.

85
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:15,247
I moved from Osaka to Tokyo
three years ago...

86
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,038
Saeko Sano.
I graduated from Nakano Municipal High..

87
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,443
My hobby is fishing

88
00:14:21,721 --> 00:14:24,817
Hi. I'm Kei Takyo.

89
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:28,843
I went to school abroad.
Nice to meet you.

90
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,495
- Nice to meet you too.
- You speak English?

91
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:34,586
- Yes...
- Do you have a boyfriend?

92
00:14:34,837 --> 00:14:36,949
No. Do you know anyone special ?

93
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:40,641
- What about me?
- Sorry, you're not my type.

94
00:14:41,727 --> 00:14:43,150
Just joke!

95
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:54,521
I'm Taro Ochiai, from Tochigi Prefecture.
My sport was judo.

96
00:14:54,878 --> 00:14:59,529
I don't throw people around, though,
so don't be afraid to talk to me.

97
00:15:02,462 --> 00:15:04,893
You're next.

98
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:08,895
- I'm from...
- I'm from...

99
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:11,711
- I'm from...
- I'm from...

100
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:20,647
I'm Go Jibiki, from Tokyo.
I live alone, so...

101
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:25,277
My motto is, 'get bigger everyday.'
I'm Tadayuki Kawasa.

102
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:30,428
I'm Uzuki Nireno, from Hokkaido.

103
00:15:32,626 --> 00:15:37,348
I'm...cheerful by nature.

104
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:44,274
I like listening to records.
Nice to meet you.

105
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:47,656
Questions?

106
00:15:50,127 --> 00:15:53,045
Is it cold in Hokkaido?

107
00:15:53,711 --> 00:15:56,629
- Yes.
- Everybody knows that!

108
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,075
Are you good at skiing?

109
00:16:01,747 --> 00:16:02,886
Uh, no...

110
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:06,233
Can't everyone up there ski?

111
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:08,768
Well, not me...

112
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,760
Why did you apply to this school?

113
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,175
Sorry?

114
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:18,473
The reason...

115
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,140
Uh, well...

116
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,218
I don't know...different reason.

117
00:16:30,172 --> 00:16:36,780
It's a nice campus...

118
00:16:41,862 --> 00:16:43,559
Sorry.

119
00:16:44,924 --> 00:16:47,355
Aren't you hot in that sweater?

120
00:16:51,847 --> 00:16:54,208
- OK, you're next.
- Who? Me?

121
00:17:41,148 --> 00:17:43,164
Can I sit here?

122
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,638
What language are you taking?

123
00:17:59,622 --> 00:18:01,948
Is French easy?

124
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:05,222
I don't know...

125
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,528
What was your name?

126
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:15,973
Nireno.

127
00:18:16,427 --> 00:18:18,051
Ms Nireno...

128
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:19,964
Uzuki.

129
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:21,913
Uzuki Nireno...

130
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:24,079
I'm saeko.

131
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:26,441
Ms saeko... Saeko Sano.

132
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:28,183
Saeko Sano...

133
00:18:43,981 --> 00:18:46,555
This food sucks.

134
00:18:55,949 --> 00:18:58,619
You busy tomorrow?

135
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:02,027
- Huh?
- Tomorrow. Sunday.

136
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:03,696
Uh...

137
00:19:04,856 --> 00:19:06,873
Want to go shopping?

138
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:10,073
- I can't tomorrow.
- You're busy?

139
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:17,763
I just moved here.
I've got to get everything sorted out.

140
00:19:18,982 --> 00:19:20,571
Next time, OK?

141
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:29,448
Sorry, what was your name?

142
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:33,340
Uzuki Nireno.

143
00:21:08,297 --> 00:21:12,366
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

144
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:11,745
Excuse me...
I'm looking for a bookstore around here...

145
00:22:12,245 --> 00:22:14,533
It's called 'Musashino-do'...

146
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:17,285
Straight ahead at the corner.

147
00:22:19,551 --> 00:22:21,662
- Left.
- Left...

148
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,590
Thank you.

149
00:22:29,536 --> 00:22:33,664
- No, no, that way!
- That way? Thank you.

150
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:45,654
Um...

151
00:23:45,904 --> 00:23:47,363
Yes?

152
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:49,900
How late are you open?

153
00:23:50,532 --> 00:23:54,529
-Till 6.
- I see.

154
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:15,796
Hideyoshi, that villain!

155
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:19,840
We're all but done for!

156
00:25:20,468 --> 00:25:22,580
I can go no further...

157
00:25:23,286 --> 00:25:27,354
My lord!
You must not give in to weakness!

158
00:25:34,803 --> 00:25:38,242
My rule was short, but I regret nothing!

159
00:25:45,831 --> 00:25:47,943
The time is changing.

160
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,702
This age of war will end.

161
00:25:53,242 --> 00:25:58,414
One day a time of peace will come.

162
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:06,179
And that is my dream, My prayer!

163
00:26:07,959 --> 00:26:13,071
That is the reason
you killed Nobunaga Oda...

164
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:16,545
...at Honnoji Temple!

165
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,266
Hideyoshi is but an upstart.

166
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:29,386
No son of his will succeed him.

167
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,860
And so who will rule...

168
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:40,861
...in the new age of peace...

169
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:44,730
Yes. Ieyasu Matsudaira.

170
00:26:45,151 --> 00:26:50,845
A shame to commit my dream to him,
but he will make it come true.

171
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,602
Mitsuhide!

172
00:26:57,746 --> 00:26:59,406
Who goes there?!

173
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,170
A dream like that sits ill upon one
such as you!

174
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:11,617
Nobunaga!

175
00:27:12,289 --> 00:27:15,135
- This cannot be!
- A ghost!

176
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,379
You think I did not expect treachery?

177
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:21,359
What?!

178
00:27:21,544 --> 00:27:25,921
How could Hideyoshi so quickly
take the field?

179
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:33,084
Then the man who died
at Honnoji Temple was a double?

180
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:37,921
Not a double. That was Ieyasu.

181
00:27:38,487 --> 00:27:42,413
- Ieyasu?!
- Ieyasu, you say?!

182
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:44,644
Ieyasu Matsudaira?!

183
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:47,837
He died for me as Nobunaga Oda.

184
00:27:49,307 --> 00:27:53,269
And I will take power and rule
under his name.

185
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:57,620
You will be Ieyasu?!

186
00:27:58,179 --> 00:28:00,753
But why such an intrigue?

187
00:28:01,206 --> 00:28:05,097
When this era ends,
Ieyasu will rule as Shogun in Edo.

188
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:09,340
There was no other way
I could take power.

189
00:28:09,973 --> 00:28:12,120
How do you know that?

190
00:28:13,626 --> 00:28:20,470
Enough!
You can think about that in hell.

191
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,474
It is my own sword
that will send you there.

192
00:28:29,388 --> 00:28:31,713
Villain!

193
00:29:44,328 --> 00:29:47,483
Keep away!

194
00:30:37,664 --> 00:30:41,104
Damn empty cans!

195
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:33,961
- What day are you closed?
- Tomorrow.

196
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,910
Hey!

197
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:40,068
Here!

198
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:45,010
Here! Look! This is yours!

199
00:34:05,406 --> 00:34:09,012
- Have you decided what club to join?
- Not yet.

200
00:34:09,198 --> 00:34:10,858
How about fishing?

201
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:16,466
Fishing?
You mean fishing as in...fishing?

202
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:19,801
It's fun.

203
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:26,721
'The Japanese Economy and
the Movement to Direct Investment'.

204
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:30,345
Turn in your reports next class.

205
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:34,072
There's different kinds of fishing.

206
00:34:34,387 --> 00:34:37,163
What we do is 'fly-fishing'.

207
00:34:38,562 --> 00:34:41,064
Have you ever heard of it?

208
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:48,476
It's a kind of stream-fishing,
but you use these artificial lures.

209
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:55,119
Could you touch a worm?

210
00:34:56,654 --> 00:35:01,173
Of course not! You're a girl.

211
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,663
But even a girl won't have any problem
with these lures.

212
00:35:10,014 --> 00:35:13,169
It suits you.

213
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:17,382
I'll give it to you.

214
00:35:23,235 --> 00:35:26,117
Did you see the film
'A River Runs Through It'?

215
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:28,831
Brad Pitt was in it.

216
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,080
- I saw it.
- You did? That's fly-fishing.

217
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:39,575
Doesn't Brad Pitt get killed
by a bear at the end?

218
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:45,187
No, he doesn't get killed by a bear...

219
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:53,076
Anyway, if you join now, you get
your own brand-new free fishing rod.

220
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,870
Wow! An Obis #4!

221
00:35:57,261 --> 00:35:59,622
That's not a beginner's rod, you know.

222
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:01,709
Well?

223
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:33,965
There they are!

224
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,110
What are they all fishing for here?

225
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:45,307
They're practicing!

226
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,228
You've got a real arm there.

227
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:07,498
- I do?
- Yeah.

228
00:37:08,724 --> 00:37:10,740
Let me see...

229
00:37:12,133 --> 00:37:16,261
You should have a different reel.

230
00:37:25,945 --> 00:37:28,447
It's like rhythm gymnastics.

231
00:37:39,479 --> 00:37:42,848
- Like that...
- Thank you.

232
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,456
An Obis #4 needs a CFO #3 reel.

233
00:37:53,883 --> 00:37:59,648
This is the best of the best.
I'll lend it to you for a while.

234
00:38:04,842 --> 00:38:08,662
Do you have any friends
who might want to fish?

235
00:38:08,913 --> 00:38:10,502
Sorry?

236
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:19,169
You can have that reel for free
if you introduce a friend.

237
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:32,287
Saeko...

238
00:38:33,128 --> 00:38:35,416
- 'Morning.
- 'Morning.

239
00:38:36,503 --> 00:38:38,377
What's your first class?

240
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:40,567
Cultural Anthropology.

241
00:38:40,991 --> 00:38:42,520
Mine's History.

242
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,534
- I can't come to the club today.
- Oh...

243
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,551
Sorry.

244
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,942
See you later.

245
00:39:09,068 --> 00:39:12,923
- Do you want to quit the club?
- No.

246
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:15,425
- You sure?
- Yes.

247
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:17,606
Excuse me...

248
00:40:23,731 --> 00:40:24,834
Sorry...

249
00:40:39,526 --> 00:40:40,557
Sorry again...

250
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,119
Here it is.

251
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:14,343
5,000 yen change.

252
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:17,726
- Would you like a cover?
- No, thanks.

253
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:18,838
OK.

254
00:42:47,943 --> 00:42:52,709
- Yes?
- Would you like to have dinner with me?

255
00:42:52,709 --> 00:42:53,990
Sorry?

256
00:42:54,936 --> 00:42:58,756
I made too much curry...

257
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:05,366
Sorry. I've already eaten.

258
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:13,371
Oh...all right, then.

259
00:45:17,721 --> 00:45:20,223
Yeah...fishing.

260
00:45:21,305 --> 00:45:25,160
Strange? You think so?

261
00:45:26,385 --> 00:45:31,557
I just wanted to do something new.

262
00:45:34,561 --> 00:45:38,274
Here? It's warm. It's like summer.

263
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,405
It cools off at night.

264
00:45:42,841 --> 00:45:46,031
Someone's at the door. Just a minute.

265
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,107
Coming!

266
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:01,863
Is something wrong?

267
00:46:02,151 --> 00:46:06,742
I just thought I shouldn't
have said no like that before.

268
00:46:07,474 --> 00:46:08,375
That's OK.

269
00:46:08,552 --> 00:46:13,937
If you've made too much,
it seems like a shame to waste it.

270
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:16,271
No, that's all right.

271
00:46:16,345 --> 00:46:18,290
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

272
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,650
If there's any left over,
I'd be happy to have some.

273
00:46:25,704 --> 00:46:28,030
You would? Thank you!

274
00:46:28,696 --> 00:46:31,269
Yes, come in, please.

275
00:46:32,732 --> 00:46:34,535
Please.

276
00:46:36,699 --> 00:46:38,051
Here.

277
00:46:46,057 --> 00:46:50,576
- Your door's a different color than mine.
- It is?

278
00:46:52,355 --> 00:46:53,636
This way.

279
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:04,144
Thank you.

280
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:10,091
Oh, just a minute. Please, sit down.

281
00:47:11,177 --> 00:47:13,395
Here, I'll do that.

282
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,099
Thanks.

283
00:47:20,501 --> 00:47:22,683
It's a nice room.

284
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,514
A real student's apartment.

285
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,332
Hello? Sorry...

286
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:51,673
No. The woman from next door.
I'll call you back later, OK?

287
00:48:08,653 --> 00:48:12,129
Yoshie? Yeah, I know her...

288
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:22,492
Really?

289
00:48:27,928 --> 00:48:31,024
Fukatsu's cool, isn't he.

290
00:48:31,929 --> 00:48:33,838
Which one is he?

291
00:48:35,373 --> 00:48:36,902
The club president!

292
00:48:44,141 --> 00:48:46,323
- Oh...
- Well?

293
00:48:49,498 --> 00:48:52,689
Do you have a boyfriend?

294
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:56,031
A boyfriend in Hokkaido?

295
00:48:57,396 --> 00:48:59,234
Someone you liked?

296
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,681
It was unrequited.

297
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,152
Same as me!

298
00:49:08,007 --> 00:49:09,810
What was he like?

299
00:49:13,052 --> 00:49:17,952
- Really cool. Smart.
- Smart?

300
00:49:18,341 --> 00:49:20,914
Yeah. Real smart.

301
00:49:21,646 --> 00:49:23,627
You like smart guys?

302
00:49:24,603 --> 00:49:27,379
Not especially...

303
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:58,189
Yamazaki went off to university
in Tokyo last spring.

304
00:50:58,749 --> 00:51:01,667
I was devastated.

305
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:38,027
Yamazaki

306
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,806
Musashino University

307
00:52:05,098 --> 00:52:07,351
Have you ever heard of 'Musashino'?

308
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,779
The university in Tokyo?

309
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:20,122
It's famous. Are you applying there?

310
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:36,196
Musashino University, Tokyo.

311
00:52:36,793 --> 00:52:41,515
My friend Onoda Natsuko said
it was famous.

312
00:52:41,802 --> 00:52:47,045
The sound of 'Musashino'
reminded me of him.

313
00:52:47,335 --> 00:52:51,439
Musashino'...'Musashino'...

314
00:52:52,345 --> 00:52:56,414
I read Musashino by Kunikida Doppo.

315
00:52:56,659 --> 00:52:59,232
I didn't really understand it.

316
00:52:59,582 --> 00:53:04,232
But after that the place,
the name 'Musashino'...

317
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,226
...rang in me like a summons.

318
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:12,453
Musashino'...'Musashino'...

319
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:20,872
The image of him in an open field
strumming his guitar...

320
00:53:21,152 --> 00:53:26,467
...was fixed in my mind
like a picture in a frame...

321
00:53:26,719 --> 00:53:28,902
...that was screwed to the wall
and wouldn't come off.

322
00:53:38,826 --> 00:53:40,415
Uzuki!

323
00:53:40,983 --> 00:53:44,459
I spent the summer studying
for my entrance exam.

324
00:53:44,706 --> 00:53:49,463
A friend who'd been down
to Tokyo came to see me.

325
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,848
Musashino

326
00:54:02,345 --> 00:54:05,370
Guess who put the cover on that book.

327
00:54:07,251 --> 00:54:09,196
Yamazaki!

328
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:14,728
On the brown paper cover...

329
00:54:15,776 --> 00:54:18,931
...was the name of a bookstore:
'Musashino-do'.

330
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:22,138
He's working part-time there.

331
00:54:24,891 --> 00:54:25,922
Yeah?

332
00:54:26,734 --> 00:54:28,679
Thanks.

333
00:54:29,623 --> 00:54:31,567
I love him...

334
00:54:34,528 --> 00:54:36,472
This writer, I mean.

335
00:54:42,426 --> 00:54:45,451
Wandering in my own Musashino...

336
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:48,787
...I'd stumbled on the place he was.

337
00:54:49,071 --> 00:54:51,397
'Musashino-do' in Musashino.

338
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:03,085
I dedicated that last six months
of my high-school years...

339
00:55:03,648 --> 00:55:05,700
...to 'Musashino'.

340
00:55:42,616 --> 00:55:44,560
Hello.

341
00:57:22,607 --> 00:57:23,781
Um...

342
00:57:24,034 --> 00:57:25,243
Yes?

343
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,030
Could I see this book, please?

344
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:33,241
The one with the yellow back.

345
00:57:38,681 --> 00:57:40,863
This one?

346
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:55,998
- Here.
- Thanks.

347
00:58:22,936 --> 00:58:24,775
Hi.

348
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:45,887
Um...

349
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:53,124
You didn't happen to go
to North High School, did you?

350
00:58:54,596 --> 00:58:57,099
Yes, I did.

351
00:58:57,727 --> 00:59:00,823
Yeah! You were a year behind me.

352
00:59:01,311 --> 00:59:02,971
You remember me?

353
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:05,336
Yeah...your name was...

354
00:59:05,626 --> 00:59:08,651
Uzuki. Uzuki Nireno.

355
00:59:09,104 --> 00:59:11,180
Why are you here?

356
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:13,901
- University.
- Here in Tokyo?

357
00:59:14,219 --> 00:59:16,792
Yes. Musashino.

358
00:59:17,872 --> 00:59:20,304
Yeah? Me, too.

359
00:59:22,951 --> 00:59:25,454
What do you know!

360
00:59:36,555 --> 00:59:38,499
That's 2,930 yen.

361
00:59:48,036 --> 00:59:49,981
From 3,030 yen.

362
00:59:54,577 --> 00:59:56,629
You live near here?

363
00:59:56,839 --> 00:59:58,048
Yes.

364
00:59:58,579 --> 01:00:00,631
Well, drop in again.

365
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:04,631
Yes...l will.

366
01:00:13,852 --> 01:00:16,035
It's started to rain...

367
01:00:16,253 --> 01:00:18,305
Well, see you.

368
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:23,209
I'll lend you an umbrella.

369
01:00:23,455 --> 01:00:25,507
That's OK, thanks.

370
01:00:27,525 --> 01:00:29,435
It's not far.

371
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:14,664
Well, Sensei,
let's have dinner sometime.

372
01:01:28,202 --> 01:01:29,660
Mr. Kato!

373
01:01:30,011 --> 01:01:32,336
Do you have an umbrella?

374
01:01:35,299 --> 01:01:37,932
- Is it raining?
- It's pouring!

375
01:01:41,388 --> 01:01:43,440
It's really coming down!

376
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:48,620
No umbrella?

377
01:01:50,677 --> 01:01:52,789
Here, use this.

378
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:54,218
No, that's OK.

379
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,725
They'll have another one inside.

380
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:02,567
Could I borrow it for just a minute?

381
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:07,305
I'll go buy one.

382
01:02:11,865 --> 01:02:14,261
I'll be right back!

383
01:02:41,891 --> 01:02:43,908
Mr. Yamazaki!

384
01:02:48,328 --> 01:02:49,917
What's wrong?

385
01:02:51,354 --> 01:02:55,802
Maybe I will borrow an umbrella.
The rain's gotten worse.

386
01:02:56,886 --> 01:02:58,618
You've got one.

387
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:04,461
Oh, this...
I borrowed it across the street.

388
01:03:05,897 --> 01:03:07,879
Hang on...

389
01:03:21,136 --> 01:03:24,291
People forget them.
Take whichever you like.

390
01:03:25,763 --> 01:03:27,495
OK, this one.

391
01:03:27,851 --> 01:03:30,555
I knew it!
I knew you'd take that one.

392
01:03:31,643 --> 01:03:32,817
'Bye.

393
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:37,694
Wait a minute!

394
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:42,771
That one's broken.

395
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:46,836
Don't worry.

396
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:49,838
No, wait a minute...

397
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:13,079
This one's fine.

398
01:04:14,819 --> 01:04:18,046
How about this? Too bright?

399
01:04:19,307 --> 01:04:22,533
This one's fine. Really.

400
01:04:29,154 --> 01:04:32,143
Are you still in a band?

401
01:04:33,607 --> 01:04:36,833
No. How did you know
I was in a band?

402
01:04:37,225 --> 01:04:39,621
You were famous.

403
01:04:40,113 --> 01:04:41,358
I was?

404
01:04:42,444 --> 01:04:45,290
With me.

405
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:49,534
I'll bring this back.

406
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,209
Forget it.

407
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:54,473
I'll bring it back.

408
01:04:56,709 --> 01:04:58,133
OK.

409
01:05:58,638 --> 01:06:02,422
Good thing you went to buy one.

410
01:06:03,474 --> 01:06:06,665
They only had the one.

411
01:06:07,058 --> 01:06:08,754
Thank you.

412
01:06:13,042 --> 01:06:14,951
Did you find that on the street?

413
01:06:15,756 --> 01:06:18,353
Yeah...

414
01:06:18,817 --> 01:06:20,477
'Bye.

415
01:06:20,835 --> 01:06:23,302
Thank you very much!

416
01:07:05,091 --> 01:07:08,637
When I made it into university...

417
01:07:09,056 --> 01:07:13,540
...my home-room teacher
said it was a miracle.

418
01:07:14,171 --> 01:07:16,911
But if it was a miracle...

419
01:07:17,476 --> 01:07:21,509
...I want to call it a miracle of love.
